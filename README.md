## Project Overview

AnythingTo3D Research focuses on the generation of 3D models using artificial intelligence. The process involves generating a 2D image based on text, removing the background, and ultimately creating 3D models from this image.

## Usage on Google Colab

1. **Generate an Image:** Use a pre-trained model to convert a text prompt into a 2D image.
2. **Remove the Background:** Apply a model to remove the background from the generated image.
3. **Generate a 3D Model:** Sample latents and generate simplified 3D models from the processed image.
4. **Visualization:** View the resulting 3D model on Google Colab.
